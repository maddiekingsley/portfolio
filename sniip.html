          <p class="center-text">Sniip is a FinTech company that has developed a digital payment option where
            customers can scan a QR or BPAY code to pay their bill. Sniip is a Brisbane based company where I
            have been from July, 2018 until Decemeber, 2019. Tasks and duties delegated to me expanded the end
            to end product and customer experience. Starting with discovery and ending with testing and approval
            of development into production, relying heavily on stories and prototypes in between.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p class="center-text">Our mission is to enable mobile payments where they are currently difficult
          to make. At Sniip our vision is to take the hassle out of paying bills and use innovative technology
          to transform paying and managing bills into an experience of effortless efficiency.<br></br>
          What do we do? All payment options in one place. The ability to generate payments from QR codes/
          non-tech media. Managing payments i.e bills.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p class="center-text">Being an in-house tech company, I worked solely on the one product for iOS
          and Android. To visual the customers journey I conducted 50 interviews to help understand what the
          journey of a bill would looked like. Starting at how they received their bill, what happens to that
          that time until payment? What do people do after they pay the bill? And finally what support do they
          need in wait of the next bill.</p>

        <h2>Who am I designing for</h2>
        <p class="center-text">After conducting interviews, and sending an questionnaire out to active
          users, we were able to create four personas. Out of the four, between the current market and who our
          current database mostly related too, we were able to distinguish a particular persona who would be
          our target demographic. We call this persona a
          <b>"Life Juggler"</b>.<br></br>
          Mainly house owners, they make mental notes about when bills are due so are more susceptible to
          missing payments. With a majority of volume and value of bills being paid manually, so they are
          dedicating a time to engage with bill payment, meaning they would be more open to utilising a tool
          to help facilitate this process will have the money in their account to cover bills.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p class="center-text">At Sniip, we worked in 2 week sprints, including the design team. For me,
          each sprint I was usually tasked with 1-3 stories, depending on the size and complexity.
          <br></br>

          When I start a story, the first thing I do is research the market. Carefully consider different call
          to actions, How are other people solving this problem? Are there commonalities? Inspiration is found
          by looking at what other people are doing. Internal interviews shape the direction and in parallel
          get feedback early. Using Slack or having a quick conversations, I ask people in the office about
          their own lived experiences, create polls in channels or send private message with my questions.

        </p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p class="center-text">After the research phase (although that continues throughout) I make use of
          the classic pencil to paper methodology. There is nothing more satisfying than taking your scattered
          ideas and thoughts and doing a massive brain dump onto paper. Sometimes the direction I need to take
          is clear therefore I jump straight into workflows or sketch some basic ideas for the design. Other
          times I have to collate my thoughts and stew of the different elements of the problem. I ask a lot
          of internal questions to myself which in turn is usually blurted out to the closest developer to
          understand my constraints or possibilities. Anyone I can get my hands on is better than being stuck
          in my own head.

          <h2>Prototype</h2>
          <p class="center-text">Next, the best ideas are selected and then I get my hands dirty in Sketch.
            Working in two week sprints, which means the faster I can get a design out to show to the team the
            better (Does fail fast ring a bell?). Roughly mocking something up is usually simple enough due to
            lot of the reusable components in our design system.
            <br></br>
            Within this phase, there might be time for 1 or 2 Product Authority Sessions. I make a quick
            walkthrough within a morning in with then is presented that afternoon to the team. Every week I have
            the opportunity to showcase designs at any stage of the process. It is my time to use it as I
            please. Previously, I have used these sessions for content writing, workshops, to present testing
            results, explore the future vision of the app or show designs from it’s early stages to pixel
            perfect designs. These sessions have helped me develop a thick skin, my designs are continuously
            critiqued, yet the team's different perspectives helps get the direction of the app on the path.

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p class="center-text">More times than I can count, I have done structured and also very loosely
          structured interviews with anyone who is willing to give me 10 minutes of their time. Friends,
          co-workers, professionals, Sniip users and family. Most of the testing I have conducted has consists
          of usability testing and think aloud walkthroughs. Working in a small company it makes it difficult
          to organise more formally structured interviews, therefore I work with the resources I have.
          <br></br>
          Some memorable interviews have stemmed from the support desk. Customers emailing in about an issue
          or a complaint, in which in turn I have helped than asked if they had further time to discuss the
          app. Why do they use Sniip? What do they enjoy about the app? And what isn’t? Talking to customers
          has always proven insightful and a wonderful experience for me.
          <br></br>
          After having a testing session I usually present my results back so that the team is on the same
          page. This is usually presented in a presentation, where they can see the tasks and questions then
          the outcomes.

          Often another showcase of the walkthrough and designs takes place to refine and clarify for

        <h2>My Role & Challenges</h2>
        <p class="center-text">
          Working at Sniip has definitely challenged me. We had in a design team of two and then in my last 3
          months a design team which helped me grow and shape my design process.
          <br></br>
          A challenge that I faced was the lack of time and resources. Research and user interviews had been
          completed, but not to the depth that would bring deeper understanding to really solidify why I am
          doing the things I am doing and for who. What data do I have that backs my claims? Something that I
          would love to incorporate into the business would be more and sooner. Ask users about future
          functionality and how they believed it would work or live. This would help lead and explain my
          designs more confidently if I had more qualitative data to back me up.
          <br></br>
          I am still learning. The design space has many interesting aspects to it, in which I believe I am
          still trying to find my speciality. Working at Sniip I was about to see the entire end to end
          development of the app, dabbled in data analytics and marketing campaigns. The benefit of working in
          a small company. You see it all.
