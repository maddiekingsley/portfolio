              Sniip is a FinTech company that offers digital payment options where customers can scan a QR or BPAY

              The mission was to enable mobile payments where they are currently difficult to make. At Sniip our

            <p>
              I worked solely on the one product for iOS and Android. To visual the customers journey I conducted
              50 interviews to help understand what the journey of a bill would looked like. Starting at how they
              received their bill, hat happens to that that time until payment? What do people do after they pay
              the bill? And finally what support do they need in wait of the next bill. After conducting
              interviews, and sending an questionnaire out to active users, here are some things we found:

              we were able to distinguish a particular persona who would be our target demographic. We call this

              <br></br>
              Mainly house owners, they make mental notes about when bills are due so are more susceptible to
              missing payments. With a majority of volume and value of bills being paid manually, so they are
              dedicating a time to engage with bill payment, meaning they would be more open to utilising a tool
              to help facilitate this process will have the money in their account to cover bills.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>
              After the research phase (although that continues throughout) I made use of the classic pencil to
              paper methodology. There is nothing more satisfying than taking your scattered ideas and thoughts
              and doing a massive brain dump onto paper. Sometimes the direction I need to take is clear therefore
              I jump straight into workflows or sketch some basic ideas for the design. Other times I have to
              collate my thoughts and stew of the different elements of the problem. I ask a lot of internal
              questions to myself which in turn is usually blurted out to the closest developer to understand my
              constraints or possibilities.

                Working in two week sprints meant the faster I could get a design out to show to the team the
                better. Roughly mocking something up using our design system made it easy.
                <br></br>
                Every week I had the opportunity to showcase designs at any stage of the process to all members in
                the team. I used these sessions for content writing, workshops, to present testing results, explore
                the future vision of the app or show designs from it’s early stages to pixel perfect designs.

                 I have faciliated structured and also very loosely structured interviews with anyone who is willing to give me 10 minutes of their time. Friends, co-workers, professionals, Sniip users and family.  Working for a small company made it difficult to organise more formally structured interviews, as I was working with the limited resources I had.
