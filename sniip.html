        <h4>About Sniip</h4>
        <p>Sniip is a FinTech company that has developed a digital payment option where customers can scan a
          QR or BPAY code to pay their bill. Sniip is a Brisbane based company where I have been from July,
          2018 until Decemeber, 2019. Tasks and duties delegated to me expanded the end to end product and
          customer experience. Starting with discovery and ending with testing and approval of development
          into production, relying heavily on stories and prototypes in between.</p>

        <h4>Challenge</h4>
        <p>Our mission is to enable mobile payments where they are currently difficult to make. At Sniip our
          vision is to take the hassle out of paying bills and use innovative technology to transform paying
          and managing bills into an experience of effortless efficiency.<br></br>
          What do we do? All payment options in one place. The ability to generate payments from QR codes/
          non-tech media. Managing payments i.e bills.</p>

          <h4>The Project</h4>
          <p>Being an in-house tech company, I worked solely on the one product for iOS and Android. To visual the customers journey I conducted 50 interviews to help understand what the journey of a bill would looked like. Starting at how they received their bill, what happens to that that time until payment? What do people do after they pay the bill? And finally what support do they need in wait of the next bill.</p>

          <h4>So who are the humans using Sniip?</h4>
          <p>After conducting interviews, and sending an questionnaire out to our user base, we were able to create four personas. Out of the four, we were able to select one persona that we would be designing for first. We call this persona a <b>"Life Juggler"</b>. They make mental notes about when bills are due so are more susceptible to missing payments. With a majority of volume and value of bills being paid manually, so they are dedicating a time to engage with bill payment, meaning they would be more open to utilising a tool to help facilitate this process will have the money in their account to cover bills.</p>
