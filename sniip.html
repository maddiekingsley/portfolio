          <h2>About Sniip</h2>
          <p class="center-text">Sniip is a FinTech company that has developed a digital payment option where
            customers can scan a QR or BPAY code to pay their bill. Sniip is a Brisbane based company where I
            have been from July, 2018 until Decemeber, 2019. Tasks and duties delegated to me expanded the end
            to end product and customer experience. Starting with discovery and ending with testing and approval
            of development into production, relying heavily on stories and prototypes in between.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p class="center-text">Our mission is to enable mobile payments where they are currently difficult
          to make. At Sniip our vision is to take the hassle out of paying bills and use innovative technology
          to transform paying and managing bills into an experience of effortless efficiency.<br></br>
          What do we do? All payment options in one place. The ability to generate payments from QR codes/
          non-tech media. Managing payments i.e bills.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p class="center-text">Being an in-house tech company, I worked solely on the one product for iOS
          and Android. To visual the customers journey I conducted 50 interviews to help understand what the
          journey of a bill would looked like. Starting at how they received their bill, what happens to that
          that time until payment? What do people do after they pay the bill? And finally what support do they
          need in wait of the next bill.</p>

        <h2>The humans using Sniip?</h2>
        <p class="center-text">After conducting interviews, and sending an questionnaire out to our user
          base, we were able to create four personas. Out of the four, we were able to select one persona that
          we would be designing for first. We call this persona a
          <b>"Life Juggler"</b>. They make mental notes about when bills are due so are more susceptible to
          missing payments. With a majority of volume and value of bills being paid manually, so they are
          dedicating a time to engage with bill payment, meaning they would be more open to utilising a tool
          to help facilitate this process will have the money in their account to cover bills.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p class="center-text">When I start a story, the first thing I do is research the market. How are
          other people solving this problem? Are there commonalities? Inspiration is found by looking at what
          other people are doing. Internal interviews shape the path towards ideation. Using slack or quick
          conversations, I ask people in the office about their own experiences, create polls or send private
          message with questions. Anyone I can get my hands on is better than being stuck in my own head.
        </p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p class="center-text">Kicking the next part of my process off takes use of the classic pencil on
          paper. There is nothing more satisfying than doing a massive brain dump with all your messy ideas
          onto paper. Sometimes it’s clear and I mock up workflows, sketch some basic ideas for the design.
          Other times I have to write thoughts, ask a lot of internal questions. In which these internal
          questions are then blurted out to the closest developer to understand my constraints or
          possibilities.

          <h2>Prototype</h2>
          <p class="center-text">I take the best ideas and get my hands dirty in Sketch. Working in two week
            sprints, I try to get a rough mock up and walkthrough within a morning in with then is presented
            that afternoon to the team. Every week I have the opportunity to showcase designs in any stage of
            the process. It is my time to use it as I please. These sessions have helped me develop a thick
            skin, as I am continuously critiqued, but I very much appreciate the team's different perspectives.

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p class="center-text">More times than I can count, I have done structured and also very loosely
          structured interviews with anyone who is willing to give me 10 minutes of their time. Friends,
          co-workers, professionals, and family. This testing mainly consists of usability testing and
          walkthroughs. Working in a small company it makes it difficult to organise more formally structured
          interviews, therefore I do with the resources I have avaliable.

        <h2>Refine</h2>
        <p class="center-text">Reflect on all of your feedback and decide if or to what extent it should be
          incorporated. It is often helpful to take solutions back through the Design Process to refine and
          clarify them. Final check with others within the business who will be developing the story.

        <h2>My Role & Challenges</h2>
        <p class="center-text">
          Over the past three years, the majority of my experience has matured within two start-ups. Small
          companies specialising in education and the payments space, in a setting where I have usually been
          the only designer. This had been a blessing but also a downfall, as I do not know what working in a
          large scale teams look like, yet I am used to handling many curve balls from the business, marketing
          and tech team.
