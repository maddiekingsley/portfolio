      <h2 class="text">Momentum Cloud | UI/UX Designer</h2>
      <div class="container-fluid paragraphs">
        <p class="center-text">
          I started working for Momentum Cloud when in November 2016. I took over a position of a Senior UX/UI
          designer which challenged me as I was fresh out of university and was my first job within UI/UX
          design. My role was focused on further designing features for a product called MyPLgoals. In this
          role I:</p>

        <div class="list">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Showed management and problem solving skills when fixing unforeseen problems within the software.
            </li>
            <li>Showed traits of being a natural leader through clear communication with the managers and
              directing the development team.</li>
            <li>
              Processed a complex amount of information. Building features for MyPLgoals was a complicated,
              multi-dimensional task. I had to understand government procedures, discuss business models and know
              the user journey.
            </li>
            <li>Used Confluence to organise scope version control, where the team could see the deisgn process
              and mockups.
            </li>
            <li>
              Added culture by celebrating birthdays with a morning tea cake. Monthly Lunches together.
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduced new process by introduced InVision App for the UX process as well as a software called
              Zeplin for development, to close the gap between design and development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Became a clearer and stronger communicator to advocate my design ideas, thought process and
              research.
            </li>
            <li>
              Documented and communicated results, made recommendations, in which helped organise product
              roadmaps.</li>
          </ul>
