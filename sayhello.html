        As employees pass one another in the walkway, the walkway initiates delightful and highly
        collaborative interactions between employees, encouraging them to say that initialâ€˜Hello'. The final
        output was built using an overhead projector to display the walkway visuals, and a Microsoft Kinect
        to track employees on the walkway. The software was built using Unity which included robust APIs to
        interface with the Microsoft Kinect. Through the power of Unity and the Microsoft Kinect, Say Hello
        was able to be successfully created and easily installed in a workplace hallway. Say Hello aims to
        achieve a sense of community throughout the workplace through simple, fun interactions. In order to
        achieve this experience, myself and my team evaluated a number of key points that play a defining
        factor in the overall success of the product.

        Through multiple user testings and brainstorm sessions, we were able to narrow down the scope of our
        goals and objectives to appropriately satisfy our underlying concept and target audience.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1.</b>
        When users walk onto the walkway they instantly know what to do
        <br>
        <b>2.</b>
        Users experience a 'cute' moment with a stranger

        Overall Success</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="container-fluid paragraphs">
        Whilst observing human interaction on the walkway at the exhibit I found that most people would
        initially play around with the line event that triggers when two or more people are on the walkway,
        forming different shapes. On occasion they would come close to each other and bubbles would merge.
        Unfortunately this was as far as the interaction would go without us telling them to try high-fiving
        or hand-shaking. As Say Hello is supposed to work over a longer period of time, this wasn't taken
        too harshley in reflections.<br><br>The
          second goal and objective was measured by the amount of smiles and laughter when the users
          discovered new and interesting interactions. These simple mannerisms expressed that they made a
          connection with another person, as well as their excitement towards the walkway.
        <br>
        <br>It was from these interactions that I believe Say Hello was an overall success and met our goals
          and objectives for the exhibit in a simple yet elegant way.
