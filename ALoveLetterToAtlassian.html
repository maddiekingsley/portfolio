          <h1>To the hiring manager of Atlassian,</h1>
          <p>
            This isn't just a cover letter for a design position, it is also a letter of love and admiration. My
            first encounter with Atlassian software was at University where as a class we had to collaboratively
            make a game. Git commands were foreign to me, and the stress of stashing, merging almost got to me
            but I discovered Sourcetree. My love for the software only grew when I started first UI/UX design
            job. JIRA and Confluence made communication flow from my managers to the developers. But it wasn't
            just the powerful ticketing system that stole my heart. I did some research into Atlassian after
            attending my first design meetup there. The no bullshit attitude, empowerment of women in tech and a
            safe place for learning is what drives me to work towards being apart of your team.

        <div class="why-i-would-fit-into-your-company">
          <p>Now you know why I am here, let me tell you what I would bring to Atlassian.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong class="markup-strong">The desire and drive to learn:
              </strong>
              from passionate co-workers and be apart of a company that impacts millions of users.
            </li>
            <li>I am neither a pure software front end developer nor a UI/UX designer. My background and
              knowledge range across both spectrums. When working with a smaller team I have had to wear many hats
              and do a bit of everything, providing me with the knowledge to understand the requirements of what
              developers need as well as attention to detail in design scopes/mockups.</li>
            <li>A pursuit to solve real-world problems and help create a positive impact on the world.</li>
            <li>I am humble being and am willing to do the work needed. I will roll up my sleeves and do it.</li>
            <li>Curiousity - I love asking questions, and a lot of them. I observe, ask questions and seek truth.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>A bit about me personally: I try to bring and spread positive energy whereever I go, there is no
            point letting negative thoughts creep in, it is simply wasted time. My interests outside the
            software world is riding my VTR250 motorcycle around Sydney and the hinterland as well as riding the
            water on water skiis'.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are reading this now, I really want to thank you for your time. It has been a pleasure for me
            to express my interest to work for Atlassian and continues to fuels desire to find a job that gets
            me outside of my comfort zone.
