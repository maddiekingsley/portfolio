          This isn't just a cover letter for a design position, it is also a letter of love and admiration. My
          first encounter with Atlassian software was at the University of Queensland. The subject was
          DECO2800, a class of 200 students had to collaboratively make a game. Git commands were foreign to
          me, and the stress of stashing, merging which had the potential hazard of conflicting with others made my head spin. Thats when I discovered Sourcetree and your software lessen the blow, visually making it easier for me to grasp the concept.
          <br></br> My love for the software only grew when I started first UI/UX design job. JIRA and Confluence made
          communication flow seamless from managers to developers. But it wasn't just the powerful ticketing
          system that stole my heart. I did some research into Atlassian after attending my first design
          meetup there. Your no bullshit attitude, empowerment of women in tech and a safe place for learning
          is what drives me even more to want to be apart of your team.
        </p>
        Now you know why I am here, let me tell you what I would bring to Atlassian.

        <div class="list">
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>A drive to learn:</strong>
              I am passionate learning and personal developement. I want to be apart of a company that impacts millions of users and collaborate on the design of new product experiences.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Natural leadership skills:</strong> I worked for a small company in which I had to wear many hats, ranging from developer, designer and product manager. This provoided me with end-to-end design process knowledge and what is required to run a team, projects and all our products. I communicated and worked closely with developers and product managers to create meaningfull software that met our customer and buisness value.</li>
            <li><strong>+2 years of front end and digital design knowledge:</strong> I am neither just a front end developer nor a UI/UX designer. My background and knowledge range across both spectrums.</li>
            <li><strong> Problem Solver: </strong> A pursuit to solve real-world problems and help create a positive impact on the world.</li>
            <li>I am humble person, an outgoing person and am driven. I will roll up my sleeves, get in there as I love to make things. I will voice humourous jokes (questionable) here and there, and bring confidence to my team.</li>
            <li><strong>I am organised:</strong> I have created spaces on Confluence and written pages of developing documentation and processes for design systems and procedures.</li>
            <li><strong> I am curious:</strong> I love asking questions, and a lot of them. I observe, ask questions and seek to understand. Sometimes I don't get it the first go, but I will continue to ask until I do, avoiding confusion. </li>
          </ol>

        <p class="center-text">
          A bit about me personally, I try to spread positive energy and make people laugh. My interests outside the
          software world is riding motorbikes around Sydney's hinterland, going to various Meetups and eating patizzis. If you are reading this now, I really want to thank you for your time. It has been a pleasure for me to express my interest to work for Atlassian.
