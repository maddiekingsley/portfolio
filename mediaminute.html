        <div class="container-fluid paragraphs">
          <p>The course, social mobile and computing brings the use of technology, design and research
            together to give the chance to create an interactive social invention. Throughout the semester, I
            was apart of a diverse group of students, placed together to work as a team to imagine and
            ultimately design a prototype that combined the problem spaces of journalism and IT as one.
            Journalism students were able to gain a greater understanding of the design process that comes hand
            in hand with technology and I personally immersed myself within the problem space that journalism is
            currently facing in this modern day and age as well as improving my research and communication
            skills.
            <br>
            <br>The inspiration for Media Minute grew from a belief that there exists a huge amount of untapped
              potential in the realm of digital news consumption. Although our approach was forward-looking and we
              were committed to making use of modern technology wherever possible, we also looked backwards. We
              looked back to a time in history where reading the news was simple and didnâ€™t depend on a data
              connection, full reception or an online subscription.

        <h2 class="text">Problem Space</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="container-fluid paragraphs">
          We envisioned a future where the news was freely available to all of us curious about what was
          happening to our city, our state, our country and our planet. Despite all our ideas and aspirations,
          it was clear we had to define the problems we were trying to solve a little more concretely. We did
          so by identifying three main issues:
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>1.</b>
          Access to digital news can be limited
          <br>
          <b>2.</b>
          Accessing news on mobile devices can cause social isolation
          <br>
          <b>3.</b>
          News consumption is a private activity, even when it takes place in public spaces

          Overall Success</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="container-fluid paragraphs">
          At all times during our design process, we worked to ensure that Media Minute did not become a
          sky-high vision without a purpose. We were committed to developing a system that worked effectively
          to solve the problems identified earlier in our work. Media Minute is the answer to the issues
          identified in our problem space because for one, it removes barriers that can arise during digital
          news consumption. Media Minute is free and available for use by all members of the public. Secondly,
          It reduces social isolation. Media Minute invites people to put away their mobile devices and
          interact alongside their fellow citizens. And lastly, it makes news consumption a public activity
          that occurs in a public space.
          <br></br>
          Overall, Media Minute was a raging success and on the night of the exhibition won "Best Overall" in
          competition with 25 other projects.
