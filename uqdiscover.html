      UQ Discover Brief
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="container-fluid paragraphs">
      Each year a new wave of students come through the halls of UQ, and it can be an overwhelming
      experience for many students as they experience new responsibilities and expectations. Because of
      this, welcoming first year students to campus and encouraging them to meet new people is a large
      part of UQ orientation week. But despite all the aid, students may not be aware of the more specific
      resources such as accessibility to submission slots, academic advisor's office, computer access to
      name a few for a certain facility. For this reason, the client requires a tool to be put forth in
      order to help first years meet other students, and have information that is directly useful to them
      and the courses they are taking. T​his tool will assist first year students with feeling comfortable
      at university and to get to know others in their courses forming friendships through playing the
      game​.
